# Overview
There is a Bash script called `balance.sh` that can be used to run the irqbalance
Python script against an example `/proc/interrupts` file.  In order to run it against
the sample `/proc/interrupts` file provided, you can run it from the project root
with the command:

* `./balance.sh proc_interrupts.txt 2`

You can run it without any argument to see simple usage info about how to run it
against other example files.
